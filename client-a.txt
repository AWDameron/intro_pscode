!!!Number Guessing Game!!!

1) number_of_guess declared here, so the loop isn't infinite.

2) While number_of_guess is less than or equal to 3, we want to run the code below
	2a) User Inputs Number (user_number)
	2b) number_of_guesses + 1 ## please declare this outside of loop ##

3) Verify IF number is NOT between 1 AND 10,
	3a) if condition is met, PRINT "Please Guess A Number Between 1 and 10"

4) ELSE: Number is between 1 and 10, 
	4a) we want to generate a random number between 1 and 10 (generated_number) and move to next IF statement


5) IF user_number is equal to generated number
	5a) PRINT "Yay! You guessed the number in number_of_guesses"

6) ELSE:
	6a) "Ope! Try Again"  ## i think it's too easy if we tell them if it's high or low. ##
	6b) Starts at step 2 again.
