!!!Number Guessing Game!!!

0) declare number_of_guesses

1) While number_of_guess is less than or equal to 3, we want to run the code below
	1a) User Inputs Number (user_number)
	1b) number_of_guesses + 1 ## please declare this outside of loop ##

2) Verify IF number is NOT between 1 AND 10,
	2a) if condition is met, PRINT "Please Guess A Number Between 1 and 10"

3) ELSE: Number is between 1 and 10, 
	3a) we want to generate a random number between 1 and 10 (generated_number) and move to next IF statement


4) IF user_number is equal to generated number
	4) PRINT "Yay! You guessed the number in number_of_guesses"

5) ELSE:
	5a) "Ope! Try Again"  ## i think it's too easy if we tell them if it's high or low. ##
	5b) Starts at step 1 again.
